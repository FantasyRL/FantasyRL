Hello there! I’m **Fanr** 👋, a second-year Computer Science student at Fuzhou University. I’m super excited about building distributed systems and enhancing DevOps practices using **Golang**, **Kubernetes**.

## **Key Projects & Experience**  
- **FzuHelper Server** (serving 23,000+ users daily) 🚀  
  - Rebuilt multiple interfaces, optimized caching layers, and improved concurrency with Kubernetes scheduling.  
- **DomTok** (an e-commerce backend in Go) 💡  
  - Integrated sentinel-based rate-limiting, Redis caching + Bloom filters, Elasticsearch-powered search, and a full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, EFK).

## **Skills & Highlights**  
- **Golang**: Familiar with concurrency (GMP model), garbage collection, popular frameworks (Kitex, Hertz, gRPC).  
- **Databases**: Experienced with MySQL (index optimization, sharding) and Redis (distributed locks, caching).  
- **Distributed Systems**: Completed MIT 6.824 labs (1–3) and comfortable with Kafka + microservice architectures.  
- **DevOps**: Skilled in Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), logging (EFK), and performance monitoring.

I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and share ideas! Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out at [1845983502@qq.com](mailto:1845983502@qq.com). Let’s build something amazing together 🤝!
